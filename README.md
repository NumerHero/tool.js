# tool.js
package some common js function 

# Why

In order to finish homework which arraged by [ife](https://github.com/baidu-ife/ife)

On the other hand, I want to strengthen my ability of using native js grammar.

# install

```
<script src="util.js"></script>
```

# Use

Before use we need instantiate a constructor

```
$ = new u();
```

And then let's get element by Id or other css selector

```
var a = $.$("#a");
var b = $.$(".b");
var c = $.$("[c]");
var d = $.$("[d=2016]");
```
